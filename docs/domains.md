## Domain Introduction

A **Domain** is a workspace that contains **Clients**, **Channels**, **Groups**, **Dashboards** as well as **Roles** and **Rules Engine** Services. A user can create as many domains as they please. A **Super Admin** has access to all domains present in the system. But a **User** must be a member or creator of a domain to log into it.

Click on the `+ Create` button on the top right to create a new domain. Since multiple domains can have the same name, you must add an **alias** which will be a unique descriptor for the domain.

Once you create a domain, you are given **Administrator** permission over the domain.
You are able to perform all actions available over the domain and all the entities provisioned inside the domain.
You can also assign or invite members to the domain with various levels of permissions.
