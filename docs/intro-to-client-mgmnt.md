title: Introduction to Client Management

Under **Magistrala** all entities are managed within **Groups**. This means that all the **Domain Members* will have certain predetermined Role Actions over all the entities.

All the **Clients** will be created under a group and their connections will depend on the group as well. Only group memebers will be able to view, update and edeit these clients as long as they have the required permissions based on their roles.

**Channels** will also be controlled from within these groups meaning that connections and connection types will also depend on the groups.

This system grants a much better level of control to the domain elements.
